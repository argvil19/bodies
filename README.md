# **HIT-BODIES**

**Temporal readme**

First commit. This isn't going to stay here for too long.

Server template. A lot of stuff to fix and remove.

This version uses Jade/SASS as renderer/css preprocessor.

To run:

1. npm install
2. npm start

### Running in port 8080

**TODO:**

* Define template structure. Views templates should only be stored inside root public folder.
* Better readme.
* Set up autodeploy to Heroku.

*Probably taking the first three days setting up a comfortable and solid workspace*
